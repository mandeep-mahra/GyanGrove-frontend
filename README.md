## Explanation of Design and Technical Decisions

- **Frontend Framework:** React.js
React.js was chosen for its component-based architecture, making it easier to manage and maintain the codebase.

- **Styling:** CSS
CSS was used for styling to keep the implementation simple and lightweight, allowing for easy customization and theming.

- **Component Structure:**
The application is structured into reusable components such as `EventCard`, `EventList`, and `EventDetails` to promote code reusability and maintainability.

- **Responsive Design:**
The application is designed to be responsive and mobile-friendly using CSS media queries to adjust the layout based on the viewport size.
